#### Experience (years / position / company):
- #### _2019 - current_: _Slalom Build_  
> * I am a software architect who as part of team built from scratch and manages a cloud-based high-scalable IoT platform contains of 20 microservices and ~50 cloud functions
with 220 000 active user profiles
> * I own and manage microservice architecture across the whole platform, including reliability metrics. As architect I create specifications of REST API for each microservice, define acceptance criterias and non-functional requirements / technical analysis of further stories for other engineers
> * As a skilled software engineer I build and manage a lot of custom infrastructure components in the platform (such as rate limiters, circuit breakers, deadlines) to achieve both high stability and scalability between services
> * I am a active member and co-lead of JVM community which hosts events for 50+ coworkers monthly-based to improve knowledge sharing and workplace culture between employees

- #### _2015 - 2019_: _Productive Edge_
> * I am a senior software engineer who works on variety of consulting projects
> * As part of team developed car parking platform including both frontend and backend to achieve online system to track 5000+ parking spots in downtown of Chicago in real time
> * As part of team refactored and made technical / design proposals to improve backend / frontend healthcare platform to reduce million(s) dollar costs of cloud expenses

- #### _2012 - 2015_: _ESRI_  
> * I am a senior software engineer who as part of team develops and maintain ArcGiS Server
> * I develop a parallel IO subsystem to manage pipelines of 100s GB of spatial data to achieve performance improvement 12 times more then previews solution
> * I provide that data output through REST API aggregated by geospatial layers
> * As a skilled engineer I delegate specific technical tasks to other engineers to achieve more efficiency in teams distributed across the world

- #### _2005 - 2011_: _Devexperts_  
> * I am a software engineer who develops and maintain highly effective quote distribution platform.
> * I develop hashmap-based scalable algorithms to quote parallel aggregation of data to achieve the most effective collapse of millions of market tickets per second to specific market charts.
